  description: >
    Students will learn foundations of computational methods for analysis of
    experimental data from genome, epigenome, and transcriptome sequencing
    experiments. The course will cover various biological data types (whole
    genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, and DNA methylation
    profiling/bisulfite sequencing), algorithms, statistical and computational
    methods, and application areas in genomics and systems biology. Prior
    coursework/experience in linear algebra, UNIX, and R and Python programming
    required.
