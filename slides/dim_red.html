### Curse of Dimensionality

<img src="images/dim_red/sphere_in_cube.png" width="500">

What is the volume of the hypersphere divided by the hypercube as $d \rightarrow \infty$?

### Curse of Dimensionality

$V_{HC} = (2r)^d$ and $V_{HS} = \frac{\pi^{d/2}r^d}{\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)}$ thus,

$\frac{V_{HS}}{V_{HC}} = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{2^{d}\Gamma(\frac{d}{2} + 1)} \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi d}} \left (\frac{\pi e}{2 d} \right )^{d/2} \rightarrow 0$

as $d \rightarrow \infty$.  And the distance between the center and corners of the hypercube is $\sqrt{d} r$.

### Curse of Dimensionality

1. Nearly all of high-dimensional space in a hypercube is distant from the center and close to the border.
2. High dimensional datasets at risk of being sparse: the average distance between two random points in:
   1. a unit square is roughly 0.52.
   2. a unit 3-d cube is roughly 0.66.
   3. a unit 1,000,000-d hypercube is $\sim$408.25.
3. Distances from a random point to its nearest and farthest neighbor are similar.
4. Distance based classification generalizes poorly unless # samples grows exponentially with $d$
