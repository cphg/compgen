## What is a standard?

> A norm or specification applied to a repeated process. It includes a formal definition of terms and a description of formats and expected behavior of a system

<p class="fragment">Standards &rarr; Interoperability</p>

What happens when there is no standard  
(or, when there are too many standards)

### Who is the target audience?

- humans?
- computers?

It's easy to build a human-friendly interface to data organized for computers. The opposite is not true.

---
### Aside: My Advice

1. Make and share your data in *computable* form
2. Make *everything* computable
	- literature text processing. we have to get text out of a PDF.

Computability is a prerequisite for interoperability

### Existing standards in genomics

- File formats
  - FASTA: DNA sequences
  - FASTQ: Short DNA sequencer reads
  - SAM/BAM: Aligned DNA sequences
  - VCF: genomic variation
  - BED: genomic intervals

---
### File formats are not enough

Say I have two BED files. Are they comparable?

File 1: 
```
chr1  15300  17300
chr1  24900  25600
chr1  72420  74440
```

File 2:
```
1  18110  19300
1  64000  65600
1  72400  74700
```

<div class="fragment">sequence names must match</div>
<div class="fragment">reference sequence must be compatible</div>

### Existing standards in genomics

- Reference genomes
  - human reference: hg18, hg19, hg38/GRCh38
  - human T2T reference
  - mouse reference: mm8, mm9, mm10
  - Other reference genomes

---
### Existing standards in genomics
- Gene names
  - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (https://www.genenames.org/)
- Gene and transcript annotation
  - GENCODE (https://www.gencodegenes.org/)

---
### RNA-seq

### GA4GH

> The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework.

- [ga4gh.org](https://www.ga4gh.org/)
- formed in 2013

---
### The increasing importance of web standards

As data and analysis become larger and more distributed, more recent standards increase involvement of web concepts

---
### RESTful API

---
### Refget

--- 
### Sequence Collections

---
### DRS

--- 
### TES

--- 
### WES

---
### Standards in genomics are important
- Genomes will always be a community resource
- It's a huge, worldwide, rapidly growing endeavor
---
### You should
- Be familiar with existing standards
- Be aware of current work on new standards

- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Contribute to the community
- Interoperability means greater impact
