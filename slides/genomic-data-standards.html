## What is a standard?

> A norm or specification applied to a repeated process. It includes a formal definition of terms and a description of formats and expected behavior of a system

What happens when there is no standard  
(or, when there are too many standards)

### Existing standards in genomics

- File formats
  - FASTA: DNA sequences
  - FASTQ: Short DNA sequencer reads
  - SAM/BAM: Aligned DNA sequences
  - VCF: genomic variation
  - BED: genomic intervals
- Reference genomes
  - GRCh38/hg38 human reference genome
  - Other reference genomes
---

### Existing standards in genomics
- Gene names
  - HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (https://www.genenames.org/)
- Gene and transcript annotation
  - GENCODE (https://www.gencodegenes.org/)
---
### Standards in genomics are important
- Genomes will always be a community resource
- It's a huge, worldwide, rapidly growing endeavor
---
### You should
- Be familiar with existing standards
- Be aware of current work on new standards

- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Contribute to the community
- Interoperability means greater impact

### GA4GH

> The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is a policy-framing and technical standards-setting organization, seeking to enable responsible genomic data sharing within a human rights framework.

- [ga4gh.org](https://www.ga4gh.org/)
- formed in 2013

### Web

As data and analysis become larger and more distributed, more recent standards increase involvement of web concepts
