### Probability and Random Variables
Define $\Omega$ as the set of all possible outcomes.

For example, fair coin thrown twice where $h=$ heads and $t=$ tails

$\Omega = \\{ hh, ht, th, tt \\}$

Definition: Discrete Random Variable $X \equiv$ A random variable that can take only a finite number of values.

Definition: $P(X=n) = \frac{\text{number of ways} X=n}{\text{total number of outcomes}}$

### Probability and Random Variables
Property: Sum of all probabilities over all values that $X$ can take equals 1:

If $X$ takes the values $x_{1}, x_{2},\dots,x_{N}$, then $\sum_{i=1}^{N} P(X = x_{i}) = 1$

Two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ taking on possible values $x_{1}, x_{2},\dots$, and $y_{1}, y_{2},\dots$ are *independent* if for all $i$ and $j$

$P(X=x_{i}, Y=y_{j}) = P(X=x_{i})P(Y=y_{j})$

### Bernoulli Random Variable
A Bernoulli random variable $X$ takes on only two values: 0 and 1, with probabilities $1-p$ and $p$ respectively.

The pobability distribution for $X$ is defined as follows:

$P(X = 1) = p(1) = p$

$P(X = 0) = p(0) = 1 - p$

$P(X = x) = p(x) = 0$ if $x \ne 0$ or $x \ne 1$

### Binomial Distribution
Assume that $n$ independent experiments or trials are performed, where $n$ is a fixed number and each experiment results in a "success" with probability $p$ and "failure" with probability $1-p$. The total number of successes, $X$, is a binomial random variable with parameters $n$ and $p$. The binomial distribution is

$P(X = k) = p(k) = \binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}$

where $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$

---
### Poisson Distribution
The Poisson distribution can be derived from the binomial distribution as the number of trials, $n$, approaches infinity (i.e., $n \rightarrow \infty$), and the probability of success on each trial, $p$, approaches zero 
(i.e., $p \rightarrow 0$), in such a way that $np = \lambda$

$P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^{k}}{k!}e^{-\lambda}$

---
### Normal Distribution
The normal distribution can be derived from the binomial distribution as the number of trials, $n$, approaches infinity (i.e., $n \rightarrow \infty$), and the probability of success on each trial, $p$, is not too close to 0 or 1

$P(X = x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-(x - \mu)^2/2\sigma^2}$

where $\mu = np$ and $\sigma^2 = np(1-p)$
