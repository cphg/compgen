## Why Statistics is important

- Statistics is the theoretical foundation of data science
- Statistics is the bridge between experiments and theories
- Statistics links microscopic and macroscopic worlds

## Models

- Quantitative/mathematical models
	- describe the relationship between quantities.

- Statistical models
	- relationship between random variables.

---
### Hypothesis testing

- General thinking:
	- Are they different?
	- Is the difference "statistically significant"?

- Statistical thinking:
	- Null hypothesis
	- Alternative hypothesis

---
## T-test

---
## Fisher's Exact Test

---
## Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mannâ€“Whitney U Test)

---
## K-S Test

---
Which of the following statements about P-values is true?

- A. P-values measure how big the difference is between the datasets compared.
- B. P-value is the probability of observing the data by random chance.
- C. P-value is the least probability of observing the data under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.

---
### ASA Statement on Statistical Significance and P-Values

	- 1. P-values can indicate how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model.
	- 2. P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true, or the probability that the data were produced by random chance alone.
	- 3. Scientific conclusions and business or policy decisions should not be based only on whether a p-value passes a specific threshold.
	- 4. Proper inference requires full reporting and transparency.
	- 5. A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.
	- 6. By itself, a p-value does not provide a good measure of evidence regarding a model or hypothesis.
